This is a repository holding my journey through competitive programming, from learning the basics (including how VS code works) to, hopefully, acing my first codeforces contest.

If you're reading this, hello! Hope you enjoy, and can learn something from here just like I did.

I have also included a pdf of "Competitive Programmers Handbook", an incredible pdf I found and am following. I've saved it here too in case it gets deleted from the web in the future.
